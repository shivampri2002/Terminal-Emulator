# Terminal-Emulator

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Terminal Emulator! This application allows users to interact with a terminal-like environment.

## Working with Pty (Pseudoterminal)

The pseudoterminal (pty) is a crucial component for enabling terminal-like functionality within the application. It consists of a pair of pseudo-devices: the pty master and the pty slave. Communication between these components occurs through the TTY driver in the operating system's kernel.

- **Pty Master**: Receives input from the application and sends output back to it.
- **Pty Slave**: Acts as the terminal device, receiving input from the pty master and sending output back to it.

- **Conpty**: as pty is not availabe on Windows system, we will use the the Conpty API made available recently by Windows.

For using this Conpty in Go, we will use this package [https://github.com/UserExistsError/conpty]
